# Project Overview

This project is a backend server for a Pinterest-like application. It uses Node.js with Express to handle HTTP routes, MongoDB for data storage via Mongoose, and several libraries for authentication, file handling, and image processing. The goal is to provide a robust API for managing users, images, and pin collections.
